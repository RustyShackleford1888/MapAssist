# Item filter rules
# "Any" can be used if you would like to see ALL uniques, all set items, all items with x sockets, etc
# Most of the time we don't want to filter that broadly, so this is commented out with #
# Any:
# - Qualities: unique/magic

# The first line or "Key" is the item base name, in the next case, "Harlequin Crest" is a unique "Shako"
# Alert to any unique Shako, regardless of any other modifiers (sockets, eth)
Shako:
 - Qualities: unique
 
# This thresher rule will look for only ethereal threshers with 4 sockets that are either normal/superior quality
Thresher:
 - Ethereal: true
   Qualities: [normal, superior]
   Sockets: [0, 4]
 - Qualities: unique 

# This mage plate rule will look for any normal/superior mage plate with 3 or 4 sockets
Mage Plate:
 - Qualities: 
    - normal
    - superior
   Sockets: [0, 3]

# This monarch rule is really 2 separate rules.  Notice the "-" on each line
# This will show all magic monarchs, as well as monarchs with 4 sockets of any quality (since quality is not specific in this rule)
Monarch:
 - Qualities: magic
 - Sockets: [4]


Any:
- Qualities: [Unique, Set]
